# Back-Up-service-using-docker-and-Kubernetes
Creating a backup service that periodically backs up the contents of a folder to Google Drive using Docker and Kubernetes . In this project, worked with Docker and Kubernetes to create a Backup service.


Deliverables:
❖ 1: Containerized Google Drive client
Here’s a high-level technical breakdown:
1. Set up Google Drive API:
◦ Obtain credentials for the Google Drive API.


◦ Use the google-api-python-client library to interact with
Google Drive.

2. Create a Docker Container:
◦ Write a Dockerfile that includes all necessary dependencies
and your backup script.
◦ Build the Docker image.
3. Write the Backup Script:
◦ Develop a script in Python that uses the Google Drive API to
upload files.
◦ Ensure the script can be triggered at regular intervals.

❖ 2: Kubernetes Deployment & Orchestration
Kubernetes CronJob:
i. Define a CronJob resource in Kubernetes to schedule the
backup operation.
ii. The CronJob will run the Docker container at specified
intervals.
Persistent Volume Claims (PVC):
i. Use PVCs in Kubernetes to ensure the data you want to back
up is accessible to the container running the backup script.
Monitoring and Logging:
i. Implement logging to track the backup process.
ii. Optionally, set up monitoring to alert you in case of failures.
Security Considerations:Testing and Validation:
i. Securely manage API credentials and sensitive data.
ii. Use Kubernetes secrets to store sensitive information.
Testing and Validation:
i. Test the backup process thoroughly to ensure data integrity.
ii. Validate the recovery process from the backups.
